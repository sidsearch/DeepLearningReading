# NIPS 2016: Generative adversarial Network by Ian Goodfellow
1. Why do we need to study generative modelling ?
	* Generative modelling helps in building a representation of high dimensional probability distributions.
	* Being able to generate data can help many ways such being able to plan. In the context of Reinforcement learning, generative models can 
	help in generate data. 
	* Generative models have been shown to be used in RL setting (A Connection between Generative Adversarial Networks, Inverse Reinforcement Learning, and Energy-Based Models (https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03852)) 
	* Generative models helps machine learnign in multimodal outputs. often algorithms have to choose a single output, but GANs can help in show that there can be many possisble outputs.
	* Higher resolution image generation for a low resolution image 
	* Creating art using GAN 
	* Convert sketches to realistic photos
