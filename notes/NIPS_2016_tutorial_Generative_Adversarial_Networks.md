# NIPS 2016: Generative adversarial Network by Ian Goodfellow
1. Why do we need to study generative modelling ?
	* Generative modelling helps in building a representation of high dimensional probability spaces.
	* Being able to generate data can help many ways such being able to plan. In the context of Reinforcement learning, generative models can 
	help in generate data. 
	* Generative models have been shown to be used in RL setting.
