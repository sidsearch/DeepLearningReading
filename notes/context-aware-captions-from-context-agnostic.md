# Context aware image captioning method 

What is this paper about?
This paper proposes method which uses a new method to get image captions using context
1. Justification 
2. Discriminative image captioning 


What is the main contribution?
1. This paper provides a novel inference method which uses introspective speaker(IS) allowing speaker(S) to reason about pragmatic behavior without additional training.
2. It  proposes 2 new tasks (a) justification (b) discriminative image captioining 
3. It also proposes a new dataset(CUB-justify) to evaluate justification systems

Describe the main approach & results. Just facts, no opinions yet.

Strengths:
1. In this papers, authors show that using a context-aware method we can further improve the captioning models. It also provides better justification.
2. One of the strength is the new dataset which can be further used to develop new context-aware image captioing models. This lays the ground for future mdoel development which are context-aware
3. The introduction of the new tasks (a) justification can be used judge the justification of the model's sentence generation 
				     (b) discriminative image captioning task will lead to model development which are better suited for discriminative tasks

Weakness:
1. Code or dataset(CUB-justify) is not available online although authors say that they will provide these artifacts.
2. Quality of writing is not very clear. Especially,
